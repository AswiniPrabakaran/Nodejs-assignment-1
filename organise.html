<h3> ORGANIZED LIVING</h3><br>
The more you try to mentally track things in your brain, the less productive youâ€™ll be.
 The first step to making a better to-do list is to get it out of your head. 
This is a key tenet of the getting things done (GTD) method, which encourages you to free up brain
 power by tracking your to-dos in a tool instead of in your head. 
Once you have all of your to-dos written down, use a to-do list tool to turn those tasks into organized, 
actionable steps. With a digital to-do list manager, you can see all of your tasks, 
deadlines, and due dates in one place, so you can take action faster and more effectively.<br>
